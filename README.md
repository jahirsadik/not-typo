## !typo - Your digital journal
An SDL2 journal application with a GUI that allows login/registration, saving journals with images, undo/redo, changing different UI elements and themes.

This is my first-year project for my C++ lab, which uses the SDL2 library. Me and my lab partner Abdullah wrote the entire code in one c++ file because we were fools. Iâ€™m preserving it here as a cherished yet somewhat embarrassing memory.
